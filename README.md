# Automated Optimization Sequence for Directional Antenna Arrays

Arduino Code in the `mechanical_optimizer` folder.
NanoVNA V2 interfacing python scripts in `nanovna-saver` folder, a cloned version of https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver. Use `vna-reader.ipynb` to interface with the NanoVNA and send readings to the Arduino through Serial communication.
